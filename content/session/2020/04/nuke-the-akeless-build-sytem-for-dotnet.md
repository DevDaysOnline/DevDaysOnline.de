As C# developers, we are spoiled with a great language and awesome IDEs. Why do build systems like PSAKE, FAKE, or CAKE never really match the level of convenience and integration that we're used to? NUKE is different. It is fully based on C# console applications and uses the type system to its full extent. You want your auto-completion, package management, debugging, refactorings, formatting, and navigation back? It's available right there! NUKE also comes with a superior dependency model, convenient parameter injection, a global tool that supports shell-completion, path separator abstraction, various build sharing options, and easy integration of third-party tools.

Come to this talk to see NUKE in action, and get a glimpse at all the opportunities it offers to make your build infrastructure maintainable again!
